# Mapping Mortality: Trends and Patterns in Australian Life Expectancy

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of mortality trends in Australia from 1921 to 2020. Utilizing a dataset from the [Human Mortality Database](https://mortality.org/Country/Country?cntr=AUS), this analysis examines key metrics such as death rates, life expectancies, and population demographics across various age groups.

This repository contains the work and materials for Assignment 4 of the ETC5450 unit (Advanced R Programming).

## Objectives

The main objectives of this report are to:

- Identify and analyze trends and shifts in mortality rates across different age groups over the past century.
- Investigate the role of age as a predictor of mortality rates.
- Provide visual representations of life expectancy and mortality trends to elucidate these patterns.
- Apply a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to understand the relationship between age and mortality rates.

## Getting Started

After cloning the project, follow these steps to get started:

1. Run `renv::restore` in console.
2. Load the targets package by running `library(targets)` in the console.
3. Execute the analysis by running `tar_make()` in the console.

These steps will allow you to run the analysis and render the report for viewing.
